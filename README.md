# About Roses & Thorns

Many people are tired of what modern social media has become. What was once a place to genuinely connect has shifted into a space that often fuels comparison, competition, and curated perfection. People share the highlights but rarely the hardships, creating an illusion of constant happiness and success. In reality, we all struggle, we all grow, and we all carry both the good and the bad.

I wanted to create an application where people can express themselves honestly, a space to reflect, to slow down, and to connect with others in a more authentic way.

## Future Plans

Roses & Thorns is still growing. Here are a few upcoming improvements and ideas I’m excited to build:

- **User Accounts & Profiles**  
  Personalized dashboards, profile customization, and the ability to follow other users.

- **Private & Anonymous Posting Modes**  
  Post privately to yourself or anonymously to the community.

  Expanding into iOS/Android for an even more accessible reflection experience.

- **UI Redesign**  
  Lean further into the journaling aesthetic by refining both the UI and UX to feel more cozy, expressive, and personal.

- **Scrapbooking Mode**  
  Introduce a scrapbook-style journaling experience—similar to Pinterest collages or Canva boards—allowing users to create unique, visual journal entries using images, stickers, textures, and layouts.
