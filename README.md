# Roses & Thorns

Roses & Thorns is a gentle, reflective social platform where users can share meaningful moments from their day — the **roses** (positives), the **thorns** (challenges), and everything in between.  
Designed with warm pastel colors and a handwritten aesthetic, the app creates a cozy space for honest expression, encouragement, and emotional reflection.
